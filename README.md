# Calculator
[Final project of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator) – a calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I decided to create the HTML mostly programmatically, which, in hindsight, might not have been a good idea. The script could be much clearer.

It was a challenging, but enjoyable task combining all the teachings of the foundations course.

## Features
* Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponentiation
* Only allows a single operation at a time. For example, `1 + 2 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9` would be evaluated as `(1 + 2) * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9` NOT `1 + (2 * 3) = 1 + 6 = 7`. This functionality was instructed in the given task.
* Equals button can be clicked repeatedly to repeat the previous operation on the result.
